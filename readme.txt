Display a shortcode within a query loop based on the loop ID, not the parent post/page ID.

== Description ==

When using the standard shortcode block within a query loop, the shortcode will render based on the
parent post/page, not the looped post/page. This plugin provides a block that will render the looped
post/page instead.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/query-loop-shortcode` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
